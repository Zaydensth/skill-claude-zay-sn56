# Playbook — summary, memory & alerts (close the loop)

Every unit of work ends by recording what you learned and telling the user what matters.

## Milestone summary (the report format)
Keep it scannable — the user is often async:
- **DONE + verified**: what changed and the measurement that proves it (numbers, not adjectives).
- **NEXT**: the ordered next steps.
- **NEEDS USER**: decisions or actions only they can do (esp. "GPU worth turning on now", a push, a submit).
- Cite `file:line`/URLs. Distinguish VERIFIED vs INFERRED. Never claim done without a measurement.

## Update the second brain (do this as you go, not just at the end)
- Save the **non-obvious** into the right `§`-box: a result + its by-code root cause, a tuned param, a user
  correction (with why + how-to-apply), a new external reference. One fact per file; update, don't duplicate;
  delete what's proven wrong; link with `[[name]]`.
- The most valuable memories are **post-mortems**: "we won/lost X because <root cause verified in code>, fix
  = <what + measured result>." That's what makes next tournament faster.
- Keep `MEMORY.md` as a one-line-per-memory index (loaded every session). Prune stale hooks.

## Alerts (when the user is away)
- Use **PushNotification** for things worth interrupting for: a long run finished, a gate passed/failed, a
  blocker that needs them (VPS down, decision required). One line, actionable.
- Don't notify for routine progress — that's what the milestone summary is for.

## Optional: a live dashboard
- If you keep a status dashboard/board, update it each session (current state, GPU busy/idle, last result,
  next step) so the user can glance instead of reading a wall of text.

## Cadence
- Small task: summary + memory at the end.
- Long autonomous run: summary at each milestone, memory continuously, one closing note when the loop ends.
