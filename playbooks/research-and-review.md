# Playbook — research, analysis & review (multi-agent workflows)

When a task is bigger than one context — diagnose a loss, design a fix, audit a diff, research a topic — fan
it out with the **Workflow** tool (deterministic orchestration of subagents) or **Agent** (a single subagent).
Scout inline first to build the work-list, THEN orchestrate.

## Core patterns (compose freely)
- **Fan-out → synthesize**: N parallel readers each cover one subsystem/angle → one synthesizer ranks findings.
- **Adversarial verify**: for every finding, spawn skeptic(s) prompted to REFUTE it; keep only what survives.
  Prevents plausible-but-wrong conclusions (the #1 failure mode).
- **Judge panel**: generate N independent solutions from different angles → score with parallel judges →
  synthesize from the winner, grafting the best of the rest.
- **Loop-until-dry**: for unknown-size discovery, keep spawning finders until K rounds return nothing new.
- **Completeness critic**: a final agent asks "what's missing / unverified?" — its answer is the next round.

## Diagnose → design (the two-phase shape that works)
1. **Diagnose workflow**: parallel deep-reads (how eval/scoring works · what our code actually does · forensics
   on winners/results) → synthesis of **ranked, cited root causes**. Read it, confirm, before designing.
2. **Design workflow**: research the fix space → judge candidate approaches → **adversarially refute** the top
   pick → emit a concrete, file-level implementation spec + an **offline verification checklist**.
Run them as separate workflows so you stay in the loop between phases.

## Rules that keep it honest
- Every claim carries a **`file:line` or URL** citation. Mark **VERIFIED vs INFERRED**.
- When two agents disagree, **resolve from the code yourself** before acting — do not average guesses.
- Have agents return **structured output** (a schema) so results compose without parsing.
- Scale effort to the ask: a quick check = a few agents; "audit thoroughly" = larger pool + adversarial pass.

## Code review
- Use the **/code-review** skill on a diff before committing anything nontrivial (correctness + simplification).
- For a fix you designed, re-run the offline verification checklist and only then call it done.
